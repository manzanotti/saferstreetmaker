    <h1>How to use the Safer Street Maker</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Safer Street Maker, where you can create the active travel network of your dreams!</p>
    <p>It's very early days of the site, so don't be surprised if you encounter the odd issue.</p>
    <p class="mb-8">Currently, you can place modal filters (which allow all traffic apart from motor vehicles through),
      and you can create mobility lanes and tram lines.
    </p>
    <h2>Modal Filters</h2>
    <p class="mb-8">To add a modal filter, click the Green Circle button in the toolbar on the left-hand side of the map,
      and just click on the map to place one. Once placed, you can click on one to delete it, or drag it to
      move it.</p>
    <h2>Mobility Lanes</h2>
    <p>To add a mobility lane (designed to be used by people on Bikes, Scooters, Wheelchairs and other
      mobility vehicles), click on the Cycle button in the toolbar. You draw the lane by placing a serious
      of points. When done, click on the last point added, and you will leave lane creation mode</p>
    <p class="mb-8">To edit a lane, click anywhere on it to enter edit mode. You can click on the fainter squares
      to add an extra point to the line, if you need one. Whilst in edit mode, you will see a popup, which
      currently has a button to delete the whole lane.</p>
      <h2>Tram Lines</h2>
      <p class="mb-8">These work in exactly the same way as mobility lanes. To add one, click on the Tram button in the toolbar. You draw the lane by placing a serious
        of points. When done, click on the last point added, and you will leave line creation mode</p>
      <h2>Saving maps</h2>
    <p class="mb-8">The map is currently automatically saved in the browser you are using. If you wish to either
      share a map with someone, use it on another device, or have more than one map, you can use the Disk
      icon to save the current map to a text file on your machine. Click on the Folder icon to load a map.
    </p>
    <h2>Tech Details</h2>
    <p class="mb-8">If you're interested, this site is built using the <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">leaflet.js</a> mapping library. It's currently built locally, using <a href="https://parceljs.org/" target="_blank">parcel.js</a>. The project is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/manzanotti/saferstreetmaker" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. This is a public repository,
      so if you wish to contribute to the project, feel free! I haven't put a readme together for it yet
      though. The site is hosted on <a href="https://www.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure</a>, as a Static Web App,
      which is
      free for a ridiculous amount of traffic.
