                Welcome to the Safer Street Maker, where you can create the
                active travel network of your dreams!
              </p>
              <p class="mb-8">
                It's very early days of the site, so don't be surprised if you
                encounter the odd issue.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-8">
                You can place various active travel features on your area. The
                idea is to use these to instigate local conversations about
                improving our towns and cities, or you can use these to respond
                to council consultations on infrastructure projects (I like to
                respond with what I think a better scheme would be).
              </p>
              <p class="mb-8">
                You can now also generate html to embed your map in another web
                page, so if you want to illustrate a blog post with an
                infrastructure map, you now can.

              </h2>
              <p class="mb-8">
                Modal filters are designed to stop motorised vehicles from
                passing. This is usually done with either bollards and planters,
                or Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras (ANPR). To add a
                modal filter, click the Green Circle button in the toolbar on
                the left-hand side of the map, and just click on the map to
                place one. Once placed, you can click on one to delete it, or
                drag it to move it.

                Modal filters are designed to stop all motorised vehicles APART
                FROM BUSES from passing. This is usually done with either
                mechanically raised bollards, or Automatic Number Plate
                Recognition cameras (ANPR). To add a bus gate, right-click the
                Green Circle button in the toolbar on the left-hand side of the
                map, select the bus icon, and just click on the map to place

              <h2>
                <input type="button" class="mobility-lane" /> Mobility Lanes
              </h2>
              <p class="mb-8">
                Most people think of a mobility lane as a cycle lane, and it's
                true that the majority of traffic on them would be people on
                bicycles. However, by designating them as Mobility lanes, this
                indicates that they are designed to also be used by people using
                mobility scooters, wheelchairs, and electric scooters. And to
                enable this requires a better design of a lane (including being
                wide enough to allow passing).
              </p>
              <p class="mb-8">
                To add a mobility lane , click on the Cycle button in the
                toolbar. You draw the lane by placing a serious of points. When
                done, click on the last point added, and you will leave lane
                creation mode.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-8">
                To edit a lane, click anywhere on it to enter edit mode. You can
                click on the fainter squares to add an extra point to the line,
                if you need one. Whilst in edit mode, you will see a popup,
                which currently has a button to delete the whole lane.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-8">
                I find that the best way of placing a lane is to put the start
                and end points of the lane whilst in create mode, click on the
                last point you added to exit create mode, then click anywhere on
                the line to go into edit mode. You can then place the extra
                points to get the lane exactly where you want it.
              </p>
              <h2><input type="button" class="tram-line" /> Tram Lines</h2>
              <p class="mb-8">
                These work in exactly the same way as mobility lanes. To add
                one, click on the Tram button in the toolbar. You draw the lane
                by placing a serious of points. When done, click on the last
                point added, and you will leave line creation mode.
              </p>
              <h2>
                <input type="button" class="car-free-street" /> Car-free Streets
              </h2>
              <p class="mb-8">
                These are streets that are not accessible to vehicles (with
                possible limited exceptions for deliveries). Again, these work
                in exactly the same way as mobility lanes. To add one, click on
                the No Vehicles button in the toolbar. You draw the lane by
                placing a serious of points. When done, click on the last point
                added, and you will leave line creation mode.
              </p>
              <h2>

              <p class="mb-8">
                These are streets around a school that are not accessible to
                vehicles during drop-off and pick-up times. Again, these work in
                exactly the same way as mobility lanes. To add one, click on the
                No Vehicles button in the toolbar. You draw the lane by placing
                a serious of points. When done, click on the last point added,
                and you will leave line creation mode.

              <h2><input type="button" class="ltn" value="LTN" /> LTNs</h2>
              <p class="mb-8">
                LTNs, or Low Traffic Neighbourhoods/Healthy Living Zones, are
                residential areas that restrict through-traffic, usually by
                placing modal filters on a group of roads. They are a critical
                part of a safe cycling network, as they provide a safe cycling
                environment on roads that cannot have mobility lanes on them
                (often due to on-street parking).
              </p>
              <p class="mb-8">
                Cars can still get to everywhere they could previously, but may
                have to take a slightly longer route. That hasn't stopped
              </p>
              <p class="mb-8">
                You draw a polygon in much the same way as you draw a line, this
                time clicking on the first point added to complete the shape.
                Clicking on one allows you to set the label text for each LTN
                block.
              </p>
